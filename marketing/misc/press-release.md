# Press Release (Event Searcher)

## Customer Testimonial

"I live in Northam and like to come down to P{rth on the weekends but I was finding it hard to find events without having to search through a series of clicks. I also dont have social media and found it really hard to find events through a google search

EVENTO was so easy to use, the information for events came up with one click. I can filter by date, what I want to see and even be more specific and search within a radius of my current location through Google Maps

I can now come to Perth and know what live events are on easily and their MAPS function make it even easier to get to my EVENTS." 
Ricardio from Northam, Western Australia

"My grandson Jake has shown me how to use EVENTO after I struggled to navigate the other event finder websites that would leave me going around in circles. With one click I was able to find out the price and link to buy tickets to the PINK FLOYD EXPERIENCE"
Sophia, The Vines

 MAIN IDEA: Create a app where users can all come to one place to search for LIVE events within their area.

Filter by event type - Postal code, genre, cost**** , DATE, Radius!!!!!

Allow a user to see location of event through Google Maps API.  SEE WHERE THE EVENT IS. DIRECTIONS TO TO EVENT

SIDE TASK (Depending on time): Restuaruants and food locations based on event radius!!!
