QUOTES

"I live in Northam and like to come down to Perth on the weekends, but I was finding it hard to find events without having to search through a series of clicks. I also don't have social media and found it really hard to find events through a google search.
EVENTO was so easy to use, the information for events came up with one click. I can filter by date, what I want to see and even be more specific and search within a radius of my current location through Google Maps.
I can now come to Perth and know what live events are on easily and their MAPS function make it even easier to get to my EVENTS."

"Picture it, Perth, 2021; I wanted to find a show to take the girls from the Bingo Club to, but it was so confusing! My grandson Jake has shown me how to use EVENTO after I struggled to navigate the other event finder websites that would leave me going around in circles. With one click I was able to find out the price and link to buy tickets to the PINK FLOYD EXPERIENCE"
-Sophia, The Vines

Background on topic/area

Trying to find a LIVE event to attend gets quite challenging, especially for those of us who just want to browse events to see what is on. Sometimes we want to find something on a certain date because friends from out of town are visiting, or we really feel like going to a Drag show, or want to know what nostalgic bands from the late 90s/2000s are coming to our city. Looking for these LIVE events sends you down a rabbit hole of clicks and random websites loading, having to put in your details when all you want to do is see what is on.
