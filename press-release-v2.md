### *Testimonials*

"I live in Northam and like to come down to Perth on the weekends, but I was finding it hard to find events without having to search through a series of clicks. I also don't have social media and found it really hard to find events through a google search.

EVENTO was so easy to use, the information for events came up with one click. I can filter by date, what I want to see and even be more specific and search within a radius of my current location through Google Maps.
I can now come to Perth and know what live events are on easily and their MAPS function make it even easier to get to my EVENTS."

"Picture it, Perth, 2021; I wanted to find a show to take the girls from the Bingo Club to, but it was so confusing! My grandson Jake has shown me how to use EVENTO after I struggled to navigate the other event finder websites that would leave me going around in circles. With one click I was able to find out the price and link to buy tickets to the PINK FLOYD EXPERIENCE"

Background on topic/area

Trying to find a LIVE event to attend can be quite challenging, especially for those of us who just want to browse events to see what is on. Currently, there's a heavy reliance on social media to find event information. When you do not want to use social media looking for these LIVE events sends you down a rabbit hole of clicks and opening new tabs to websites, having to put in your details when all you want to do is see what is on.   

Sometimes we want to find something on a certain date because friends from out of town are visiting, or we really feel like going to a Drag show, or want to know what nostalgic bands from the late 90s/2000s are coming to our city.
